# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This branch contains two different datasets, "cardio_train" and "heart-full" datasets.

The dataset "cardio_train" dataset is taken from Kaggle, and this is the link to the dataset information : https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset. Cardiovascular Disease Prediction notebook contains various classification models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, etc and is trained on the "cardio_train" dataset.

The "heart-full" dataset is also taken from Kaggle, but has different parameters, and can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci. The notebook SVM_HeartDiseasePrediction is based on the dataset "heart-full"
